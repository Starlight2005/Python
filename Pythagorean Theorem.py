# Pythagorean Theorem 

a = int(input('Enter a: ')) # Take as 2 for example
b = int(input('Enter b: ')) # Take as 4 for example

c = (a**2 + b**2) ** 0.5 # "c" is hypotenuse 

print(c) # Answer should be 4.47213595499958

# Can put any whole number as for "a" and "b" values, you will get different answers as for "c" according to the values put
